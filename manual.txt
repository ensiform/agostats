AGOStats explained.

Requirements (what do I need to make statistics ?)

A computer running linux or windows.
"seta logfile 1" in your ETF configuration so the etconsole.log file is created during games.


Installation (where do I put it ?)

Extract the package to the ET\etf directory


Usage (how do I start this mofo ?)

Doubleclick agostats, or do whatever you do to start up programs :-)

AGOStats will work fine as it is but there are some special options you can activate through commandline parameters.

Commandline parameters (agostats.exe -x -y -z)
-h               : display help for commandline parameters
-?               : display help for commandline parameters
-a               : keep individual player highscores in agostats_data directory
                 : open the file agostats_data\players.html
-f<options>      : customize output filename
                 : special options t(timestamp),n(mapname),r(teamscores)c(name passed with -o parameter)
                 : combine options for example -ft-n-r see below for more examples

-o<custom filename> : custom output filename, use in combination with -fc parameter


-i<logfile>      : filename of logfile
-o<outputfile>   : filename of outputfile
-l               : only do stats for last game in logfile
-p<offset>       : start processing from fileposition <offset>
-r               : take input from stdin, sent output to stdout
-t<tablenumbers> : change table sequence, -t123456789 is the default table order. 
                   Table 9 is only displayed if option -m or -e is used.
-m               : show global messages (mm1)
-e               : show events (capture, connect, kick, etc)
-v               : display programname and version


Commandline examples:
agostats -e -m -id:\games\ET\ETF\qconsole.log
agostats -t12345

Custom filename examples:
agostats -ft              : 20060204-2119.htm
agostats -fn              : etf_hardcore.htm
agostats -fr              : BLUE-6-RED-1.htm
agostats -ft-n-r          : 20060204-2119-eft_hardcore-BLUE-6-RED-1.htm
agostats -ft+n+r          : 20060204-2119+eft_hardcore+BLUE-6-RED-1.htm
agostats -ostats -fc      : stats.htm
agostats -ostats -fct     : stats20060204-2119.htm
agostats -ostats -fc-t    : stats-20060204-2119.htm


Custom table sequence:
The -t parameter is followed by a series of numbers. Each number is a table, right now there are 9 tables :

   1. Final score of the game
   2. The Prima Donnas
   3. Capture history
   4. The Teams
   5. The Players
   6. Player vs Player
   7. The Awards
   8. Detailed player info
   9. Global chat and events

If you wish to see all tables in default order you could use -t123456789 (in combination with -m or -e)
To see all the tables in reverse order use -t987654321
If you only wish to see table 1 then use -t1
Some examples for the -t parameter:

agostats.exe -t1 -> create stats only containing the team scores.
agostats.exe -t3 -> create stats only containing the capture history.
agostats.exe -t333 -> create stats containing the capture history 3 times.


Changing the appearance (I want a yellow background ffs)

As of version 0.49 it is possible to change the appearance of the statistics. This is done with the help of an external (CSS) stylesheet. External means it's an extra file and it's called agostats.css. Every statistics file generated by agostats has a link to this file (as long as it's located in the same directory as the stats.htm file). If agostats.css exists it will be used to set the appearance (style) of the statistics. If the file does not exist the appearance is determined by the style settings in the stats.htm document.

Things that you can change or set: fonts, colors, pictures, alignments, sizes. Basically anything you can do with CSS. To learn more about CSS visit this place: http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

Ok, so I can change the appearance by editting agostats.css ? Give me some examples!

Open agostats.css in your favourite txt editor.
Insert these background properties in the BODY class and make the url point to a picture of your girlfriend, your dog or whatever. The picture will be aligned to the top right and stay in that position even if you scroll the stats up and down.

    BODY         { background-color: #000000;
                   color: #FFFFFF;
                   font-family: verdana;
                   font-size: 12px ;
                   background-image: url(pictures/my_gf.jpg);
                   background-repeat: no-repeat;
                   background-attachment: fixed;
                   background-position : top right;
                 }

I want to change all the colors from ET and make them all white so every playername is white.
There you go:
    .ET_C0  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    .ET_C1  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    .ET_C2  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    .ET_C3  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    .ET_C4  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    .ET_C5  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    .ET_C6  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    .ET_C7  { color : #FFFFFF; }
    
    .ET_C8  etc.
    
Ok, LOL, I'm so funny. How do I switch the red and blue teamcolors ?

Yeah real funny, change these definitions:
    .COLOR_TEAM_RED         { color : #0000FF; }
    .COLOR_TEAM_BLUE        { color : #FF0000; }
    .BACKGROUND_TEAM_RED    { background : #0000FF; }
    .BACKGROUND_TEAM_BLUE   { background : #FF0000; }
    
What does "px" mean ?

px means pixels, and there is always a number in front of it. For instance "border: 5px" means the border has a width of 5pixels. If you want to remove a border then use border: 0px. Really the best way to find things out is to change values and refresh your browser to see what changed.                                                                                                       
Someone just gave me a link to some stats on a website but it's looking awful. The teamcolors are wrong and there is some ugly chick in the background. Is there any way I can fix it ?

Sure there is. Just save the html file in the directory where you have your own agostats.css. The statistics will now appear in your personally defined style.

good luck, have fun
